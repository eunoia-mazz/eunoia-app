## üß™ Testing

### Overview

The Eunoia App includes a comprehensive test suite to ensure the reliability and functionality of the application. The tests cover various components including authentication, chat functionality, activity tracking, spiritual content, and more.

### Test Structure

Tests are organized in the `tests/unit/` directory with each module focusing on a specific area of functionality:

- **test_auth.py**: Tests user authentication (signup, login)
- **test_chat.py**: Tests chat creation and message generation
- **test_activity.py**: Tests activity and subactivity models
- **test_coupon.py**: Tests coupon allocation functionality
- **test_spiritual.py**: Tests spiritual content features
- **test_profile.py**: Tests user profile management
- **test_journal.py**: Tests journal entry functionality
- **test_forum.py**: Tests forum post and comment features
- **test_mood.py**: Tests mood tracking functionality

### Running Tests

To run the entire test suite:

```bash
cd tests
python run_tests.py
```

To run a specific test file:

```bash
cd tests
python -m unittest unit.test_auth
```

### Continuous Integration

Tests are automatically run on GitHub Actions when code is pushed to the main branch or when a pull request is created. The workflow configuration is defined in `.github/workflows/python-tests.yml`.

### Test Coverage

The tests use SQLite in-memory databases to ensure tests are isolated and don't affect production data. Key areas covered include:

1. **Authentication**
   - User registration
   - User login with valid and invalid credentials

2. **Chat Functionality**
   - Creating new chats
   - Generating AI responses (with mocked AI model)
   - Retrieving chat history

3. **Activities**
   - Activity model validation
   - SubActivity model validation
   - Relationship between activities and subactivities

4. **Coupons**
   - Coupon allocation to users
   - Validation of coupon limits

5. **Spiritual Content**
   - Creating spiritual guidance chats
   - Testing chat creation

6. **User Profiles**
   - Profile retrieval through login

### Adding New Tests

When adding new features, corresponding tests should be created following the existing patterns:

1. Create a new test class that inherits from `unittest.TestCase`
2. Implement `setUp` and `tearDown` methods
3. Add test methods that start with `test_`
4. Update `run_tests.py` to include your new test case

### Mocking External Services

For tests that involve external services (like AI models), we use Python's `unittest.mock` to create mock responses:

```python
@patch('app.model.generate_content')
def test_some_ai_feature(self, mock_generate_content):
    # Set up the mock
    mock_response = MagicMock()
    mock_response.text = "This is a mock response"
    mock_generate_content.return_value = mock_response
    
    # Test code that uses the AI model
```
