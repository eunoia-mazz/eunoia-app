# Eunoia
Eunoia is an AI-powered mental health web application, designed to offer personalized emotional support, mental well-being tools, and religious therapy. The platform integrates advanced features such as AI-driven sentiment analysis, journaling, mood tracking, habit-building tools, and crisis management resources. Additionally, the app will provide real-time chatbot assistance, peer support forums, relaxing soundscapes, stress-relief games, and gamified elements to motivate users in their mental health journey.
The application will be built as a Progressive Web App (PWA), ensuring cross-platform accessibility with offline functionality for key features. Multilingual support is integrated to accommodate a diverse user base, and future scalability will allow the inclusion of spiritual support from other religious texts, catering to broader audiences. Users will also have the option to connect with certified therapists for professional mental health support.
The methodology includes a combination of AI-driven personalization, spiritual guidance based on user sentiment, habit-tracking for mental well-being improvement, and community-building tools. Expected outcomes include improved user emotional regulation, enhanced spiritual comfort, better mental health habits, and an accessible, scalable platform offering personalized mental health care for Muslims and other potential audiences.
This solution addresses the lack of culturally and spiritually relevant mental health tools by blending modern technology with faith-based emotional support, ultimately promoting holistic mental well-being.
