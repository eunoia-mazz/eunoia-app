      "Before discovering Eunoia, I never really thought about prioritizing my mental health. I was constantly stressed, juggling work, personal life, and never taking the time to check in with myself. Eunoia has changed all of that. The mood tracker and journaling features allow me to reflect on my emotions, while the breathing exercises help calm my mind throughout the day. ",
